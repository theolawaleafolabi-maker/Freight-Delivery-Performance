Freight Cost &amp; Delivery Performance Dashboard 
Where are Our Money Going To? 🚚💰

Let me be honest: We just discovered €4M was vanishing into thin air.

Our freight costs hit €93M last quarter. Standard, right? But then we built this dashboard and the story got interesting.

Here's what the data revealed:

UPS is bleeding red at €19M—our most expensive carrier. Meanwhile, GIG Logistics is running lean at €17M for similar volumes. That's a €2M opportunity right there.

The route analysis? Even more telling. Some destinations are running 20-30% over budget (those pink bars towering over blue). Frankfurth and Hannover are our cost hotspots, while Munich is surprisingly efficient.

And that 40% on-time delivery rate? That's not just a number—it's delayed customer satisfaction, rushed emergency shipments, and premium freight charges we shouldn't be paying.

For the analysts: The variance breakdown by route gives us actionable insights. We can now negotiate carrier contracts with specific route performance data, not gut feelings.

For the decision-makers: This is €4M in variance we can reclaim through carrier optimization, route restructuring, and delivery performance improvements.

The dashboard didn't solve our problem. But it made the invisible visible.

What hidden costs are lurking in your logistics data?
